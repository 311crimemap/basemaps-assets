# basemaps-assets (WIP)
Fonts and sprites for [basemaps](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps).

## Directory Structure

* `fonts/`: Contains PBF glyphs generated by [font-maker](https://github.com/maplibre/font-maker)
  * By convention, the name of the font has spaces and names the Latin font; fallbacks for the rest of the Unicode BMP default to Noto Sans in the appropriate weight.
 
* `sprites/v3`: Contains spritesheets generated by [spreet](https://github.com/flother/spreet), for each major version
  * `light@x.png` - light and dark themed spritesheets at 1x and 2x pixel densities
